Your goal here, is to help us to understand.

 1 - Find the malicious sample family.
 2 - Find the hostname.
 3 - Find the username.
 4 - Find the date (mm/dd/year).
 5 - What should you do to perform containment?
 6 - What do you think about this event behavior? Is it True or False?
```
```sh
B - Open the Archive2 json file and analyze:
 1 - Find the user involved in this event.
 2 - Find all IPs and write about there are. 
 3 - What could a hacker do inside this network?
 4 - What do you think about this event behavior? What could've happened here? Is it True or False?
```
```sh
